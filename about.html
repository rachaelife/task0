          <p>
            Beyond coding, I believe in the power of community and collaboration. The tech industry thrives
            when we share knowledge, support each other, and celebrate wins together. I'm excited to be part
            of the Frontend Wizards community and to contribute to a culture of learning and growth.

          <p>
            I'm also passionate about making technology accessible to everyone. Whether it's through writing
            clean, semantic code or mentoring others, I want to help bridge the gap between complex technology
            and user-friendly experiences.
